# Horiseon_Refactor_Challenge

## Description

Horiseon Refactor Challenge was a project where original HTML and CSS code were given and we had to go through it to make it sematic. Nothing on the webpage was changed, but the code now looks cleaner and more readable. DIV's were removed to create sematic tags. CSS was changed using "classes" to make it more readable. Comments were made in the CSS file to what was altered.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

With semantics and classes used, the code is easier to go through to make changes if needed.
